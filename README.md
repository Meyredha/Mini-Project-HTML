This repository showcases a static web page developed exclusively using HTML5, serving as a comprehensive exercise in mastering the foundational structure of web development. 
The core objective of this mini-project is to demonstrate proficiency in creating a clean, accessible, and semantically structured document before introducing styling or interactivity. 
We've utilized advanced semantic HTML elements, including <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>, to ensure content is logically organized and easily parsable by assistive 
technologies and search engines. Key skills demonstrated involve the proper structuring of various content types: using ordered and unordered lists for sequencing information, implementing 
basic data tables with <thead> and <tbody> for clarity, and embedding images with crucial alt attributes. Furthermore, the project includes structured forms (using <label>, <input>, and 
<textarea>) to practice data collection scaffolding. This pure HTML approach highlights the essential skeleton upon which any robust web application must be built, proving a solid 
understanding of the web's most fundamental language.
